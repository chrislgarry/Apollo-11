# Purpose: 	Part of the source code for Luminary 1A build 099.
#		It is part of the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM)
#		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), for Apollo 11.
# Assembler:	yaYUL
# Contact:	Onno Hommes <ohommes@cmu.edu>.
# Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
# Pages:	0090-0152
# Mod history:	2009-05-16 OH	Transcribed from page images.
#		2009-06-05 RSB	Eliminated a variable that shouldn't have
#				survived from Luminary 131.
#		2010-12-31 JL	Fixed page number comment.
#
# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# CONVENTIONS AND NOTATIONS UTILIZED FOR ERASABLE ASSIGNMENTS.

#	EQUALS	IS USED IN TWO WAYS.  IT IS OFTEN USED TO CHAIN A GROUP
#		OF ASSIGNMENTS SO THAT THE GROUP MAY BE MOVED WITH THE
#		CHANGING OF ONLY ONE CARD.  EXAMPLE:
#
#			X	EQUALS	START
#			Y	EQUALS	X	+SIZE.X
#			Z	EQUALS	Y	+SIZE.Y
#
#		(X, Y, AND Z ARE CONSECUTIVE AND BEGIN AT START.
#		SIZE.X AND SIZE.Y ARE THE RESPECTIVE SIZES OF X AND Y.
#		USUALLY NUMERIC, IE. 1, 2, 6, 18D, ETC.)

#	EQUALS	OFTEN IMPLIES THE SHARING OF REGISTERS (DIFFERENT NAMES
#		AND DIFFERENT DATA).  EXAMPLE:
#
#			X	EQUALS	Y

#	=	MEANS THAT MULTIPLE NAMES HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE SAME DATA.
#		(THIS IS LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE, NOT SHARING.)  EXAMPLE:
#
#			X	=	Y

#	THE SIZE AND UTILIZATION OF AN ERASABLE ARE OFTEN INCLUDED IN
#	THE COMMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING FORM:  M(SIZE)N.
#
#		M	REFERS TO THE MOBILITY OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
#			B	MEANS THAT THE SYMBOL IS REFERENCED BY BASIC
#				INSTRUCTIONS AND THUS IS E-BANK SENSITIVE.
#			I	MEANS THAT THE SYMBOL IS REFERENCED ONLY BY
#				INTERPRETIVE INSTRUCTIONS, AND IS THUS E-BANK
#				INSENSITIVE AND MAY APPEAR IN ANY E-BANK.
#
#		SIZE	IS THE NUMBER OF REGISTERS INCLUDED BY THE SYMBOL.
#
#		N	INDICATES THE NATURE OF PERMANENCE OF THE CONTENTS.
#			PL	MEANS THAT THE CONTENTS ARE PAD LOADED.
#			DSP	MEANS THAT THE REGISTER IS USED FOR A DISPLAY.
#			PRM	MEANS THAT THE REGISTER IS PERMANENT.  IE., IT
#				IS USED DURING THE ENTIRE MISSION FOR ONE
#				PURPOSE AND CANNOT BE SHARED.
#			TMP	MEANS THAT THE REGISTER IS USED TEMPORARILY OR
#				IS A SCRATCH REGISTER FOR THE ROUTINE TO WHICH
#				IT IS ASSIGNED.  THAT IS, IT NEED NOT BE SET
#				PRIOR TO INVOCATION OF THE ROUTINE NOR DOES IT
#				CONTAIN USEFUL OUTPUT TO ANOTHER ROUTINE.  THUS
# Page 91
#				IT MAY BE SHARED WITHANY OTHER ROUTINE WHICH
#				IS NOT ACTIVE IN PARALLEL
#			IN	MEANS INPUT TO THE ROUTINE AND IT IS PROBABLY
#				TEMPORARY FOR A HIGHER-LEVEL ROUTINE/PROGRAM.
#			OUT	MEANS OUTPUT FROM THE ROUTINE, PROBABLY
#				TEMPORARY FOR A HIGHER-LEVEL ROUTINE/PROGRAM.
