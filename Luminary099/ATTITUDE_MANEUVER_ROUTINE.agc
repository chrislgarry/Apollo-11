# BLOCK 2 LGC ATTITUDE MANEUVER ROUTINE -- KALCMANU
#
# MOD 2		DATE 5/1/67	BY DON KEENE
#
# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
#
# KALCMANU IS A ROUTINE WHICH GENERATES COMMANDS FOR THE LM DAP TO CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPACECRAFT
# DURING FREE FALL.  IT IS DESIGNED TO MANEUVER THE SPACECRAFT FROM ITS INITIAL ORIENTATION TO SOME DESIRED
# ORIENTATION SPECIFIED BY THE PROGRAM WHICH CALLS KALCMANU, AVOIDING GIMBAL LOCK IN THE PROCESS.  IN THE
# MOD 2 VERSION, THIS DESIRED ATTITUDE IS SPECIFIED BY A SET OF OF THREE COMMANDED CDU ANGLES STORES AS 2'S COMPLEMENT
# SINGLE PRECISION ANGLES IN THE THREE CONSECUTIVE LOCATIONS, CPHI, CTHETA, CPSI, WHERE
#
#	CPHI = COMMANDED OUTER GIMBAL ANGLE
# 	CTHETA = COMMANDED INNER GIMBAL ANGLE
#	CPSI = COMMANDED MIDDLE GIMBAL ANGLE
#
# WHEN POINTING A SPACECRAFT AXIS (I.E., X, Y, Z, THE AOT, THRUST AXIS, ETC.) THE SUBROUTINE VECPOINT MAY BE
# USED TO GENERATE THIS SET OF DESIRED CDU ANGLES (SEE DESCRIPTION IN R60).
#
# WITH THIS INFORMATION KALCMANU DETERMINES THE DIRECTION OF THE SINGLE EQUIVALENT ROTATION (COF ALSO U) AND THE
# MAGNITUDE OF THE ROTATION (AM) TO BRING THE S/C FROM ITS INITIAL ORIENTATION TO ITS FINAL ORIENTATION.
# THIS DIRECTION REMAINS FIXED BOTH IN INERTIAL COORDINATES AND IN COMMANDED S/C AXES THROUGHOUT THE
#                  _
# MANEUVER.  ONCE COF AND AM HAVE BEEN DETERMINED, KALCMANU THEN EXAMINES THE MANEUVER TO SEE IF IT WILL BRING
#				       _
# THE S/C THROUGH GIMBAL LOCK.  IF SO, COF AND AM ARE READJUSTED SO THAT THE S/C WILL JUST SKIM THE GIMBAL
# LOCK ZONE AND ALIGN THE X-AXIS.  IN GENERAL A FINAL YAW ABOUT X WILL BE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE MANEUVER.
# NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEITHER THE INITIAL NOR THE FINAL ORIENTATION CAN BE IN GIMBAL LOCK.
#
# FOR PROPER ATTITUDE CONTROL THE DIGITAL AUTOPILOT MUST BE GIVEN AN ATTITUDE REFERENCE WHICH IT CAN TRACK.
# KALCMANU DOES THIS BY GENERATING A REFERENCE OF DESIRED GIMBAL ANGLES (CDUXD, CDUYD, CDUZD) WHICH ARE UPDATED
# EVERY ONE SECOND DURING THE MANEUVER.  TO ACHIEVE A SMOOTHER SEQUENCE OF COMMANDS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE UPDATES,
# THE PROGRAM ALSO GENERATES A SET OF INCREMENTAL CDU ANGLES (DELDCDU) TO BE ADDED TO CDU DESIRED BY THE DIGITAL
# AUTOPILOT.  KALCMANU ALSO CALCULATES THE COMPONENT MANEUVER RATES (OMEGAPD, OMEGAQD, OMEGARD), WHICH CAN
#				      _
# BE DETERMINED SIMPLY BY MULTIPLYING COF BY SOME SCALAR (ARATE) CORRESPONDING TO THE DESIRED ROTATIONAL RATE.
#
# AUTOMATIC MANEUVERS ARE TIMED WTH THE HELP OF WAITLIST SO THAT AFTER A SPECIFIED INTERVAL THE Y AND Z
# DESIRED RATES ARE SET TO ZERO AND THE DESIRED CDU ANGLES (CDUYD, CDUZD) ARE SET EQUAL TO THE FINAL DESIRED CDU
# ANGLES (CTHETA, CPSI).  IF ANY YAW REMAINS DUE TO GIMBAL LOCK AVOIDANCE, THE FINAL YAW MANEUVER IS
# CALCULATED AND THE DESIRED YAW RATE SET TO SOME FIXED VALUE (ROLLRATE = + OR - 2 DEGREES PER SEC).
# IN THIS CASE ONLY AN INCREMENTAL CDUX ANGLE (DELFROLL) IS SUPPLIED TO THE DAP.  AT THE END OF THE YAW
# MANEUVER OR IN THE EVENT THAT THERE WAS NO FINAL YAW, CDUXD IS SET EQUAL TO CPHI AND THE X-AXIS DESIRED
# RATE SET TO ZERO.  THUS, UPON COMPLETION OF THE MANEUVER THE S/C WILL FINISH UP IN A LIMIT CYCLE ABOUT THE
# DESIRED GIMBAL ANGLES.
#
# PROGRAM LOGIC FLOW
#
# KALCMANU IS CALLED AS A HIGH PRIORITY JOB WITH ENTRY POINTS AT KALCMAN3 AND VECPOINT.  IT FIRST PICKS
# UP THE CURRENT CDU ANGLES TO BE USED AS THE BASIS FOR ALL COMPUTATIONS INVOLVING THE INITIAL S/C ORIENTATION.
# Page 343
# IT THEN DETERMINES THE DIRECTION COSINE MATRICES RELATING BOTH THE INITIAL AND FINAL S/C ORIENTATION TO STABLE
#               *   *                                                                               *
# MEMBER AXES (MIS,MFS).  IT ALSO COMPUTES THE MATRIX RELATING FINAL S/C AXES TO INITIAL S/C AXES (MFI).  THE
# ANGLE OF ROTATION (AM) IS THEN EXTRACTED FROM THIS MATRIX, AND TEST ARE MADE TO DETERMINE IF
#
#	A)	AM LESS THAN .25 DEGREES (MINANG)
#	B)	AM GREATER THAN 170 DEGREES (MAXANG)
#
# IF AM IS LESS THAN .25 DEGREES, NO COMPLICATED AUTOMATIC MANEUVERING IS NECESSARY.  THEREFORE, WE CAN SIMPLY
# SET CDU DESIRED EQUAL TO THE FINAL CDU DESIRED ANGLES AND TERMINATE THE JOB.
#
# IF AM IS GREATER THAN .25 DEGREES BUT LESS THAN 170 DEGREES THE AXES OF THE SINGLE EQUIVALENT ROTATION
#   _                                                       *
# (COF) IS EXTRACTED FROM THE SKEW SYMMETRIC COMPONENTS OF MFI.
#                                                                                     *     *
# IF AM GREATER THAN 170 DEGREES AN ALTERNATE METHOD EMPLOYING THE SYMMETRIC PART OF MFI (MFISYM) IS USED
#               _
# TO DETERMINE COF.
#
# THE PROGRAM THEN CHECKS TO SEE IF THE MANEUVER AS COMPUTED WILL BRING THE S/C THROUGH GIMBAL LOCK.  IF
# SO, A NEW MANEUVER IS CALCULATED WHICH WILL JUST SKIM THE GIMBAL LOCK ZONE AND ALIGN THE S/C X-AXIS.  THIS
# METHOD ASSURES THAT THE ADDITIONAL MANEUVERING TO AVOID GIMBAL LOCK WILL BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM.  SINCE A FINAL
# P AXIS YAW WILL BE NECESSARY, A SWITCH IS RESET (STATE SWITCH 31) TO ALLOW FOR THE COMPUTATION OF THIS FINAL
# YAW.
#
# AS STATED PREVIOUSLY, KALCMANU GENERATES A SEQUENCE OF DESIRED GIMBAL ANGLES WHICH ARE UPDATED EVERY
#                                                                                              _
# SECOND.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY A SMALL ROTATION OF THE DESIRED S/C FRAME ABOUT THE VECTOR COF.  THE NEW
# DESIRED REFERENCE MATRIX IS THEN,
#	 *		 *	 *
#	MIS	=	MIS	DEL
#	   N+1		   N
#        *
# WHERE DEL IS THE MATRIX CORRESPONDING TO THIS SMALL ROTATION.  THE NEW CDU ANGLES CAN THEN BE EXTRACTED
#       *
# FROM MIS.
#
# AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MANEUVER THE AUTOPILOT DESIRED RATES (OMEGAPD, OMEGAQD, OMEGARD) AND THE
# MANEUVER TIMINGS ARE ESTABLISHED.  ON THE FIRST PASS AND ON ALL SUBSEQUENT UPDATES THE CDU DESIRED
# ANGLES ARE LOADED WITH THE APPROPRIATE VALUES AND THE INCREMENTAL CDU ANGLES ARE COMPUTED.  THE AGC CLOCKS
# (TIME1 AND TIME2) ARE THEN CHECKED TO SEE IF THE MANEUVER WILL TERMINATE BEFORE THE NEXT UPDATE.  IF
# NOT, KALCMANU CALLS FOR ANOTHER UPDATE (RUN AS A JOB WITH PRIORITY TBD) IN ONE SECOND.  ANY DELAYS IN THIS
# CALLING SEQUENCE ARE AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATED IN CALLING FOR THE NEXT UPDATE.
#
# IF IT IS FOUND THAT THE MANEUVER IS TO TERMINATE BEFORE THE NEXT UPDATE A ROUTINE IS CALLED (AS A WAIT-
# LIST TASK) TO STOP THE MANEUVER AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.

# CALLING SEQUENCE
#
# IN ORDER TO PERFORM A KALCMANU SUPERVISED MANEUVER, THE COMMANDED GIMBAL ANGLES MUST BE PRECOMPUTED AND
# STORED IN LOCATIONS CPHI, CTHETA, CPSI.  THE USER'S PROGRAM MUST THEN CLEAR STATE SWITCH NO 33 TO ALLOW THE
# ATTITUDE MANEUVER ROUTINE TO PERFORM ANY FINAL P-AXIS YAW INCURRED BY AVOIDING GIMBAL LOCK.  THE MANEUVER IS
# THEN INITIATED BY ESTABLISHING THE FOLLOWING EXECUTIVE JOB

#	L	TC	BANKCALL
#	L+1	CADR	ATTSTALL
#	L+2	(BAD RETURN)
#	L+3	(GOOD RETURN)
#
# UPON COMPLETION OF THE MANEUVER, THE PROGRAM WILL BE AWAKENED AT L+3 IF THE MANEUVER WAS COMPLETED
# SUCCESSFULLY, OR AT L+2 IF THE MANEUVER WAS ABORTED.  THIS ABORT WOULD OCCUR IF THE INITIAL OR FINAL ATTITUDE
# WAS IN GIMBAL LOCK.
#
# *** NOTA BENE ***  IF IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DESIRED MANEUVERING RATE (0.5, 2, 5, 10 DEG/SEC) HAS BEEN SELECTED BY
# KEYBOARD ENTRY PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION OF KALCMANU.
#
# IT IS ALSO ASSUMED THAT THE AUTOPILOT IS IN THE AUTO MODE.  IF THE MODE SWITCH IS CHANGED DURING THE
# MANEUVER, KALCMANU WILL TERMINATE VIA GOODEND WITHIN 1 SECOND SO THAT R60 MAY REQUEST A TRIM OF THE S/C ATTITUDE
# SUBROUTINES.
#
# KALCMANU USES A NUMBER OF INTERPRETIVE SUBROUTINES WHICH MAY BE OF GENERAL INTEREST.  SINCE THESE ROUTINES
