# Pages:	1338-1340
# Mod history:	2009-05-27 RSB	Adapted from the corresponding
#				Luminary131 file, using page
#				images from Luminary 1A.

# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# 'UPLINK ACTIVITY LIGHT' IS TURNED OFF BY .....
#	   1.	  VBRELDSP

#
#				    _
# THE RECEPTION OF A BAD CODE(I.E  CCC FAILURE) LOCKS OUT FURTHER UPLINK ACTIVITY BY SETTING BIT4 OF FLAGWRD7 = 1.
# THIS INDICATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GROUND BY THE DOWNLINK WHICH DOWNLINKS ALL FLAGWORDS.
# WHEN UPLINK ACTIVITY IS LOCKED OUT ,IT CAN BE ALLOWED WHEN THE GROUND UPLINKS AND 'ERROR RESET' CODE.
# (IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE 'ERROR LIGHT RESET' CODE IS PRECEEDED BY 16 BITS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS 1 FOLLOWED
# BY 15 ZEROES. THIS WILL ELIMINATE EXTRANEOUS BITS FROM INLINK WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OVER FROM THE ORIGINAL
# FAILURE)
# UPLINK ACTIVITY IS ALSO ALLOWED(UNLOCKED) DURING FRESH START WHEN FRESH START SETS BIT4 OF FLAGWRD7 = 0.
