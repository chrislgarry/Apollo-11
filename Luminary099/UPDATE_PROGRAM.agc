# Purpose: 	Part of the source code for Luminary 1A build 099.
#		It is part of the source code for the Lunar Module's (LM)
#		Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC), for Apollo 11.
# Assembler:	yaYUL
# Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>.
# Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
# Pages:	1386-1396
# Mod history:  2009-05-10 SN   (Sergio Navarro).  Started adapting
#				from the Luminary131/ file of the same
#				name, using Luminary099 page images.
#		2009-06-07 RSB	Added an SBANK= to account for incompatibilities
#				between YUL and yaYUL.
#		2011-01-06 JL	Fixed pseudo-label indentation.
#		2011-05-07 JL	Flag SBANK= workaround.

# This source code has been transcribed or otherwise adapted from
# digitized images of a hardcopy from the MIT Museum.  The digitization
# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# LOG SECTION:      UPDATE PROGRAM.
#
# FUNCT. DESCR:     P27 (THE UPDATE PROGRAM) PROCESSES COMMANDS AND DATA
#                       INSERTIONS REQUESTED BY THE GROUND VIA UPLINK.
#                       THE P27 PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT UPDATES
#                       ONLY DURING P00 FOR THE LM, AND ONLY DURING P00,
#                   P02, AND FRESH START FOR THE CSM
#
# CALLING SEQ:      PROGRAM IS INITIATED BY UPLINK ENTRY OF VERBS 70, 71, 72 AND 73.
#
# SUBROUTINES:      TESTXACT, NEWMODEX, NEWMODEX +3, GOXDSPF, BANKCALL, FINDVAC, INTPRET, INTSTALL, TPAGREE,
#                   INTWAKEU, ENDEXT, POSTJUMP, FALTON, NEWPHASE, PHASCHNG
#
# NORMAL EXIT:      TC ENDEXT
#
# ALARM/ABORT:      TC FALTON FOLLOWED BY TC ENDEXT
#
# RESTARTS:         P27 IS RESTART PROTECTED IN TWO WAYS...
#                   1. PRIOR TO VERIFLAG INVERSION(WHICH IS CAUSED BY THE GROUND/ASTRONAUT'S VERIFICATION OF UPDATE
#                      DATA BY SENDING A V33E WHEN V21N02 IS FLASHING)---
#                      NO PROTECTION EXCEPT PRE-P27 MODE IS RESTORED, COAST + ALIGN DOWNLIST IS SELECTED AND UPLINK
#                      ACTIVITY LIGHT IS TURNED OFF.(JUST AS IF A V34E WAS SENT DURING P27 DATA LOADS).
#                      V70,V71,V72 OR V73 WILL HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY RESENT BY USER.
#                   2. AFTER VERIFLAG INVERSION(WHEN UPDATE OF THE SPECIFIED ERASABLES IS BEING PERFORMED)---
#                      PROTECTED AGAINST RESTARTS.
#
# DEBRIS:           UPBUFF   (20D)  TEMP STORAGE FOR ADDRESSES AND CONTENTS.
#                   UPVERB   (1)    VERB NUMBER MINUS 70D (E.G., FOR V72, UPVERB = 72D - 70D = 2)
#                   UPOLDMOD (1)    FOR MAJOR MODE INTERRUPTED BY P27.
#                   COMPNUMB (1)    TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPONENTS TO BE TRANSMITTED.
#                   UPCOUNT  (1)    ACTUAL NUMBER OF COMPONENTS RECEIVED.
#                   UPTEMP   (1)    SCRATCH, BUT USUALLY CONTAINS COMPONENT NUMBER TO BE CHANGED DURING VERIFY CYCLE
