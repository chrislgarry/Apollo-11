# DISPLAYS CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES-
#	1.  PRIORITY DISPLAYS- DISPLAYS WHICH TAKE PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER DISPLAYS.  USUALLY THESE DISPLAYS ARE SENT
#	    OUT UNDER CRITICAL ALARM CONDITIONS.
#	2.  EXTENDED VERB DISPLAYS- ALL EXTENDED VERBS AND MARK ROUTINES SHOULD USE EXTENDED VERB (MARK) DISPLAYS.
#	3.  NORMAL DISPLAYS- ALL MISSION PROGRAM DISPLAYS WHICH INTERFACE WITH THE ASTRONAUT DURING THE NORMAL
#	    SEQUENCE OF EVENTS.
#	4.  MISC. DISPLAYS- ALL DISPLAYS NOT HANDLED BY THE DISPLAY INTERFACEROUTINES.  THESE INCLUDE SUCH DISPLAYS AS
#	    MM DISPLAYS AND SPECIAL PURPOSE DISPLAYS HANDLED BY PINBALL.
#	5.  ASTRONAUT INITIATED DISPLAYS- ALL DISPLAYS INITIATED EXTERNALLY.
#
# THE FOLLOWING TERMS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE THE STATUS OF DISPLAYS-
#	1.  ACTIVE-THE DISPLAY WHICH IS (1) BEING DISPLAYED TO THE ASTRONAUT AND WAITING FOR A RESPONSE OR
#	    (2) WAITING FIRST IN LINE FOR THE ASTRONAUT TO FINISH USING THE DSKY OR (3) BEING DISPLAYED ON THE DSKY
#	    BUT NOT WAITING FOR A RESPONSE.
#	2.  INACTIVE -A DISPLAY WHICH HAS (1) BEEN ACTIVE BUT WAS INTERRUPTEDBY A DISPLAY OF HIGHER PRIORITY,
#	    (2) BEEN PUT INTO THE WAITING LIST AT TIME IT WAS REQUESTED DUE TO THE FACT A HIGHER PRIORITY DISPLAY
#	    WAS ALREADY DOING, (3) BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE ASTRONAUT (CALLED A PINBRANCH CONDITION, SINCE THIS TYPE
#	    OF INACTIVE DISPLAY IS USUALLY REACTIVATED ONLY BY PINBALL) OR (4) A DISPLAY WHICH HAS FINISHED BUT STILL
#	    HAS INFO SAVED FOR RESTART PURPOSES.
#
# DISPLAY PRIORITIES WORK AS FOLLOWS-
#	INTERRUPTS-
#		1.  THE ASTRONAUT CAN INTERRUPT ANY DISPLAY WITH AN EXTERNAL DISPLAY REQUEST.
#		2.  INTERNAL DISPLAYS CAN NOT BE SENT OUT WHEN THE ASTRONAUT IS USING THE DSKY.
#		3.  PRIORITY DISPLAYS INTERRUPT ALL OTHER TYPES OF INTERNAL DISPLAYS.  A PRIORITY DISPLAY INTERRUPTING ANOTHER
#		    PRIORITY DISPLAY WILL CAUSE AN ABORT UNLESS BIT14 IS SET FOR THE LINUS ROUTINE.
#		4.  A MARK DISPLAY INTERRUPTS ANY NORMAL DISPLAY.
#		5.  A MARK THAT INTERRUPTS A MARK COMPLETELY REPLACES IT.
#
# 	ORDER OF WAITING DISPLAYS-
#		1.  ASTRONAUT EXTERNAL USE
#		2.  PRIORITY
#		3.  INTERRUPTED MARK
#		4.  INTERRUPTED NORMAL
#		5.  MARK TO BE REQUESTED (SEE DESCRIPTION OF ENDMARK)
#		6.  MARK WAITING
#		7.  NORMAL WAITING
#
# Page 1342
# THE DISPLAY ROUTINES ARE INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE USER AND PINBALL.  THE
# FOLLOWING STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE ABOUT NORMAL DISPLAYS AND PRIORITY DISPLAYS (A DESCRIPTION OF MARK ROUTINES
# WILL FOLLOW LATER):
#	1.  ALL ROUTINES THAT END IN R HAVE AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO THE USER.  FOR ALL FLASHING DISPLAYS THIS RETURN
#	    IS TO THE USERS CALL CADR +4.  FOR THE ONLY NON FLASHING IMMEDIATE RETURN DISPLAY (GODSPR) THIS RETURN
#	    IS TO THE USERS CALLING LOC +1.
#	2.  ALL ROUTINES NOT ENDING IN R DO NOT DO AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO THE USER.
#	3.  ALL ROUTINES THAT END IN R START A SEPARATE JOB (MAKEPLAY) WITH USERS JOB PRIORITY.
#	4.  ALL ROUTINES NOT ENDING IN R BRANCH DIRECTLY TO MAKEPLAY WHICH MAKES THESE DISPLAYS A PART OF THE
#	    USERS JOB.
#	5.  ALL DISPLAY ROUTINES ARE CALLED VIA BANKCALL.
#	6.  TO RESTART A DISPLAY THE USER WILL GENERALLY USE A PHASE OF ONE WITH DESIRED RESTART GROUP (SEE
#	    DESCRIPTION OF RESTARTS).
#	7.  ALL FLASHING DISPLAYS HAVE 3 RETURNS TO THE USER FROM ASTRONAUT RESPONSES.  A TERMINATE (V34) BRANCHES
#	    TO THE USERS CALL CADR +1.  A PROCEED (V33) BRANCHES TO THE USERS CALL CADR +2.  AN ENTER OR RECYCLE
#	    (V32) BRANCHES TO THE USER'S CALL CADR +3.
#	8.  ALL ROUTINES MUST BE USED UNDER EXECUTIVE CONTROL
#
# A DESCRIPTION OF EACH ROUTINE WITH AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWS:
#	GODSP IS USED TO DISPLAY A VERB NOUN ARRIVING IN A.  NO RETURN IS MADE TO THE USER.
#		1.  GODSP IS NOT RESTARTABLE
#		2.  A VERB PASTE WITH GODSP ALWAYS TURNS ON THE FLASH.

# RESTARTING DISPLAYS--
#
# RULES FOR THE DSKY OPERATOR--
#	1.  PROCEED AND TERMINATE SERVE AS RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR OPERATOR RESPONSE (FLASHING V/N).  AS LONG
#	    AS THERE IS ANY REQUEST AWAITING OPERATOR RESPONSE, ANY USE OF PROCEED OR TERMINATE WILL SERVE AS
#	    RESPONSES TO THAT REQUEST.  CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN ATTEMPTING TO KILL AN OPERATOR INITIATED MONITOR
#	    WITH PROCEED AND TERMINATE FOR THIS REASON.
#	2.  THE ASTRONAUT MUST RESPOND TO A PRIORITY DISPLAY NO             SOONER THAN 2 SECONDS FROM THE TIME THE
#	    PROGRAM SENT OUT THE REQUEST FOR OPERATOR RESPONSE (THE ASTRONAUT WOULD SEE THIS DISPLAY FOR LESS TIME
#	    DUE TO TIME IT TAKES TO GET DISPLAY SENT OUT.)  IF THE ASTRONAUT RESPONDS TOO SOON, THE PRIORITY DISPLAY
#	    IS SENT OUT AGAIN -- AND AGAIN UNTIL AN ACCUMULATED 2 SECS     FROM THE TIME THE FIRST PRIORITY DISPLAY
#	    OUT.  THE SAME 2 SEC. DELAY WILL OCCUR AT 163.84 SECS OR IN ANY  MULTIPLE OF THAT TIME DUE TO PROGRAM
#	    CONSIDERATION.
#	3.  KEY RELEASE BUTTON-
#	    A)  IF THE KEY RELEASE LIGHT IS ON, IT SIMPLY RELEASES THE KEYBOARD AND DISPLAY FOR INTERNAL USE.
#	    B)  IF THE KEY RELEASE LIGHT IS OFF, AND IF SOME REQUEST FOR OPERATOR RESPONSE (FLASHING V/N) IS STILL
#	        AWAITING RESPONSE  THEN IT RE-ESTABLISHES THE DISPLAYS THAT ORIGINALLY REQUESTED RESPONSE.
#	    IF AN OPERATOR WANTS THEREFORE TO RE-ESTABLISH BUT CONDITION (A) IS ENCOUNTERED, A SECOND DEPRESSION OF
#	    KEY RELEASE BUTTON MAY BE NECESSARY.
#	4.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO ANSWER ALL REQUESTS FOR OPERATOR RESPONSE.
#	5.  IT IS ALWAYS GOOD PRACTICE TO TERMINATE AN EXTENDED VERB BEFORE ASKING FOR ANOTHER ONE OR THE SAME ONE
#	    OVER AGAIN.
#
# SPECIAL CONSIDERATONS--
# Page 1353
#	1.  MPAC +2  SAVED ONLY IN MARK DISPLAYS
#	2.  GODSP(R),REGODSP(R),GOMARK(R) ALWAYS TURN ON THE FLASH IF ENTERED WITH A PASTE VERB REQUEST.
#	3.  ALL NORMAL DISPLAYS ARE RESTARTABLE EXCEPT GODSP(R), REGODSP(R)
#	4.  ALL EXTENDED VERBS WITH DISPLAYS SHOULD START WITH A TC TESTXACT AND FINISH WITH A TC ENDEXT.
#	5.  GODSP(R) AND REGODSP(R) MUST BE IN THE SAME EBANK AND SUPERBANK AS THE LAST NORMAL DISPLAY RESTARTED
#	    BY A .1 RESTART PHASE CHANGE.
#	6.  IN ORDER TO SET UP A NON DISPLAY .1 RESTART POINT, THE USER MUST MAKE CERTAIN THAT RESTREG CONTAINS THE
#	    CORRECT PRIORITY AND SUPERBANK AND THAT EBANKTEM CONTAINS THE CO
#	7.  IF CLEANDSP IS RESTARTED VIA A .1 PHASE CHANGE, CAF ZERO SHOULD BE EXECUTED BEFORE THE TC BANKCALL.
