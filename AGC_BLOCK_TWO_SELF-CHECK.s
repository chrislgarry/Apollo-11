# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION				DATE:  20 DECEMBER 1967
# PROGRAM NAME -- SELF-CHECK			LOG SECTION:  AGC BLOCK TWO SELF-CHECK
# MOD NO -- 1					ASSEMBLY SUBROUTINE UTILITYM REV 25
# MOD BY -- GAUNTT
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#	PROGRAM HAS TWO MAIN PARTS.  THE FIRST IS SELF-CHECK WHICH RUNS AS A ZERO PRIORITY JOB WITH NO CORE SET, AS
#	PART OF THE BACK-UP IDLE LOOP.  THE SECOND IS SHOW-BANKSUM WHICH RUNS AS A REGULAR EXECUTIVE JOB WITH ITS OWN
# 	STARTING VERB.
#
#	THE PURPOSE OF SELF-CHECK IS TO CHECK OUT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COMPUTER AS OUTLINED BELOW IN THE OPTIONS.
#
#	THE PURPOSE OF SHOW-BANKSUM IS TO DISPLAY THE SUM OF EACH BANK, ONE AT A TIME.
#
#	IN ALL THERE ARE 7 POSSIBLE OPTIONS IN THIS BLOCK II VERSION OF SELF-CHECK.  MORE DETAIL DESCRIPTION MAY BE
#	FOUND IN E-2065 BLOCK II AGC SELF-CHECK AND SHOW BANKSUM BY EDWIN D. SMALLY DECEMBER 1966, AND ADDENDA 2 AND 3.
#
#	THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS ARE CONTROLLED BY PUTTING DIFFERENT NUMBERS IN THE SMODE REGISTER (NOUN 27).  BELOW IS
# 	A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT PARTS OF THE COMPUTER THAT ARE CHECKED BY THE OPTIONS, AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER, IN
#	OCTAL, TO LOAD INTO SMODE.
#		+-4		ERASABLE MEMORY
#		+-5		FIXED MEMORY
#		+-1,2,3,6,7,10	EVERYTHING IN OPTIONS 4 AND 5.
#		-0		SAME AS +-10 UNTIL AN ERROR IS DETECTED.
#		+0		NO CHECK, PUTS COMPUTER INTO THE BACKUP IDLE LOOP.
#
# WARNINGS
#	USE OF E MEMORY RESERVED FOR SELF-CHECK (EVEN IN IDLE LOOP) AS TEMP STORAGE BY OTHER PROGRAMS IS DANGEROUS.
#	SMODE SET GREATER THAN OCT 10 PUTS COMPUTER INTO BACKUP IDLE LOOP.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE
#	TO CALL SELF-CHECK KEY IN
#		V 21 N 27 E	OPTION NUMBER E
#	TO CALL SHOW-BANKSUM KEY IN
#		V 91 E		DISPLAYS FIRST BANK
#		V 33 E		PROCEED, DISPLAYS NEXT BANK
#
# EXIT MODES, NORMAL AND ALARM
#	SELF-CHECK NORMALLY CONTINUES INDEFINITELY UNLESS THERE IS AN ERROR DETECTED.  IF SO + OPTION NUMBERS PUT
#	COMPUTER INTO BACKUP IDLE LOOP, - OPTION NUMBERS RESTART THE OPTION.
#
#	THE -0 OPTION PROCEEDS FROM THE LINE FOLLOWING THE LINE WHERE THE ERROR WAS DETECTED.
#
#	SHOW-BANKSUM PROCEEDS UNTIL A TERMINATE IS KEYED IN (V 34 E).  THE COMPUTER IS PUT INTO THE BACKUP IDLE LOOP.
#
# OUTPUT
# Page 1395
#	SELF-CHECK UPON DETECTING AN ERROR LOADS THE SELF-CHECK ALARM CONSTANT (01102) INTO THE FAILREG SET AND
#	TURNS ON THE ALARM LIGHT.  THE OPERATOR MAY THEN DISPLAY THE THREE FAILREGS BY KEYING IN V 05 N 09 E.  FOR FURTHER
# 	INFORMATION HE MAY KEY IN V 05 N 08 E, THE DSKY DISPLAY IN R1 WILL BE ADDRESS+1 OF WHERE THE ERROR WAS DETECTED,
#	IN R2 THE BBCON OF SELF-CHECK, AND IN R3 THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ERRORS DETECTED BY SELF-CHECK SINCE THE LAST MAN
#	INITIATED FRESH START (SLAP1).
#
#	SHOW-BANKSUM STARTING WTIH BANK 0 DISPLAYS IN R1 THE BANK SUM (A +-NUMBER EQUAL TO THE BANK NUMBER), IN R2
#	THE BANK NUMBER, AND IN R3 THE BUGGER WORD.
#
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED
#	ACCOMPLISHED BY FRESH START
#		SMODE SET TO +0
#
# DEBRIS
#	ALL EXITS FROM THE CHECK OF ERASABLE (ERASCHK) RESTORE ORIGINAL CONTENTS TO REGISTERS UNDER CHECK.
#	EXCEPTION IS A RESTART.  RESTART THAT OCCURS DURING ERASCHK RESTORES ERASABLE, UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE TO DOUBT
#	E MEMORY, IN WHICH CASE PROGRAM THEN DOES A FRESH START (DOFSTART).
