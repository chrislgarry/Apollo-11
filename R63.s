# was performed by Paul Fjeld, and arranged for by Deborah Douglas of
# the Museum.  Many thanks to both.  The images (with suitable reduction
# in storage size and consequent reduction in image quality as well) are
# available online at www.ibiblio.org/apollo.  If for some reason you
# find that the images are illegible, contact me at info@sandroid.org
# about getting access to the (much) higher-quality images which Paul
# actually created.

# SUBROUTINE NAME:	V89CALL
# MOD NO:	0			DATE:		9 JAN 1968
# MOD BY:	DIGITAL DEVEL GROUP	LOG SECTION:	R63
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
#
# CALLED BY VERB 89 ENTER DURING P00.  PRIO 10 USED.  CALCULATES AND
# DISPLAYS FINAL FDAI BALL ANGLES TO POINT LM +X OR +Z AXIS AT CSM.
#
# 1. KEY IN V 89 E ONLY IF IN PROG 00.  IF NOT IN P00, OPERATOR ERROR AND
# EXIT R63, OTHERWISE CONTINUE.
#
# 2. IF IN P00, DO IMU STATUS CHECK ROUTINE (R02BOTH).  IF IMU ON AND ITS
# ORIENTATION KNOWN TO LGC, CONTINUE.
#
# 3. FLASH DISPLAY V 04 N 06.  R2 INDICATES WHICH SPACECRAFT AXIS IS TO
# BE POINTED AT CSM.  INITIAL CHOICE IS PREFERRED (+Z) AXIS (R2=1).
# ASTRONAUT CAN CHANGE TO (+X) AXIS (R2 NOT =1) BY V 22 E 2 E.  CONTINUE
# AFTER KEYING IN PROCEED.
#
# 4. BOTH VEHICLE STATE VECTORS UPDATED BY CONIC EQS.
#
# 5. HALF MAGNITUDE UNIT LOS VECTOR (IN STABLE MEMBER COORDINATES) AND
# HALF MAGNITUDE UNIT SPACECRAFT AXIS VECTOR (IN BODY COORDINATES)
# PREPARED FOR VECPOINT.
#
# 6. GIMBAL ANGLES FROM VECPOINT TRANSFORMED INTO FDAI BALL ANGLES BY
# BALLANGS.  FLASH DISPLAY V 06 N 18 AND AWAIT RESPONSE.
#
# 7 	RECYCLE -- RETURN TO STEP 4.
#	TERMINATE -- EXIT R63
#	PROCEED -- RESET 3AXISFLAG AND CALL R60LEM FOR ATTITUDE MANEUVER.
#
# CALLING SEQUENCE:	V 89 E.
#
# SUBROUTINES CALLED:	CHECKP00H, R02BOTH, GOXDSPF, CSMCONIC, LEMCONIC,
#			VECPOINT, BALLANGS, R60LEM.
#
# NORMAL EXIT MODES: 	TC ENDEXT
#
# ALARMS:	1. OPERATOR ERROR IF NOT IN P00.
#		2. PROGRAM ALARM IF IMU IS OFF.
#		3. PROGRAM ALARM IF IMU ORIENTATION IS UNKNOWN.
#
# OUTPUT:	NONE
#
# ERASABLE INITIALIZATION REQUIRED:  NONE
#
# DEBRIS:	OPTION1, +1, TDEC1, PCINTVSM, SCAXIS, CPHI, CTHETA, CPSI,
